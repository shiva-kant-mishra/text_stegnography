# Text Stegnography
Steganography is the practice of concealing a message within another message or a physical object. 
In computing/electronic contexts, a computer file, message, image, or video is concealed within another file, message, image, or video.

Under this project a simple text ecryption and decryption tool using java. The message fed to the tool will be encrypted and placed in a txt file .
When the decrypt button is pressed the message is fetched from the encrypted txt file and displayed on the console.

## Logic for encyption :

It converts the input message into spaces. It creates a encrypted.txt file which appears to be blank but contains spaces corresponding to the text entered as message.
