# Text Stegnography
Steganography is the practice of concealing a message within another message or a physical object. 
In computing/electronic contexts, a computer file, message, image, or video is concealed within another file, message, image, or video.

Under this project a simple text ecryption and decryption tool using java. The message fed to the tool will be encrypted and placed in a txt file .
When the decrypt button is pressed the message is fetched from the encrypted txt file and displayed on the console.

## Logic for encyption :

It converts the input message into spaces. It creates a encrypted.txt file which appears to be blank but contains spaces corresponding to the text entered as message.

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get this application up &
running.

```
step 1: copy all the image files and source code file project.java in a folder
step 2: Use either shell or any IDE that supports java to comple and run the code
```

## Features

The application provides a simple GUI interface using Java Swing. It has an encode and decode button as shown in the below screenshot.

Once the message is entered encryption is completed and now on clicking decode the message will be fetched from encrypted.txt and displayed on the console.

This is how the file encrypted.txt will appear on opening it. There would be no content in it but if select all is done something gets highlighted that is actually spaces that corresponds to the message entered.
